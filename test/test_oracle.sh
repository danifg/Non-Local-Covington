# This script verifies the implementation of a transition system by running
# them on a dataset, and verifying the oracle sequence with a more transparent
# implementation of it. The first argument is the dataset (.conll* file) to
# run the test on, the second argument is the acronym for the transition
# system to be tested, and the third argument is the mappings files. For the
# latter two please refer to the README.md file in the root directory of this
# repository. For the first argument, note that the dataset should contain only
# projective parses for all tests to pass.
#
# This script should be run from the root directory of the repository.
